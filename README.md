I'm a bit curious of how all the codes work.

Selenium is often used in my many projects. So when I have learned `Golang`, I searched for a module that acts like selenium or the selenium official module for golang. But all I found was not the thing I always wanted.

And so I'm trying to do the thing of browser automation by myself :mag:

Wish me Luck!
